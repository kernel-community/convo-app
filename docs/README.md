# Architectural Design Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Design Records (ADRs) that document important technical decisions made throughout the project's development.

## Purpose

ADRs capture the context, decision, and consequences of significant architectural choices. They help:
- Preserve decision-making rationale for future reference
- Onboard new team members by explaining why certain approaches were chosen
- Avoid revisiting settled decisions without proper context
- Maintain consistency across the codebase

## Naming Convention

- Start with `DR` followed by a three-digit incremented number and an underscore
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the decision being documented
- Format: `DR###_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME.md`
- Example: `DR032_Database_Migration_Strategy.md`

## Structure

Each ADR should follow this general structure:
1. **Title**: Clear, concise description of the decision
2. **Context**: Background information and problem being solved
3. **Consequences**: Expected outcomes, trade-offs, and implications
