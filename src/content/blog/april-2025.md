This month: Communities, Nook (new feature) for beta users, improved profiles, co-proposing and waitlisting features, and optimized platform performance.

### Updates
- **Co-hosting**: Propose events with multiple hosts, share responsibilities, and collaborate on event planning. Co-hosts can edit event details, manage RSVPs, and communicate with attendees
- **Proposers can now pick a timezone when creating events**, making it easier to coordinate across different regions and avoid confusion about event timing
- **Renewed Communities**: Communities now have dedicated spaces, custom branding options, and enhanced member management capabilities. Hover over the logo on top left to see the community
- **Better management of Events for the proposers**: Improved event management dashboard (inside `Manage Event` accordion)
- **Profile pages**: Enhanced user profiles with customizable fields, interests/tags display, current affiliation, personal website links, and a comprehensive view of organized events. The new profile layout makes it easier to discover shared interests and connect with other community members
- **Nook**: Only for beta. A new feature that helps you discover and connect with other members based on shared interests, past event attendance, and mutual connections. View your network, explore potential connections, and see how you're connected to others in the community

### Performance Optimizations

- Improved database query performance for event listings
- Implemented aggressive caching for commonly accessed data
- Reduced API response times with better server-side optimization

### How to Check if You're a Beta User

To check if you have beta access:
1. Look for the **beta** badge in the top navigation bar
2. If you have an `@kernel.community` email address, you automatically have beta access
3. Beta users can access Nook by visiting `/nook` directly

Don't have beta access yet? reach out to me directly at [angela@kernel.community](mailto:angela@kernel.community) or [DM on Slack](https://kernel-community.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=U01D1166621)
