We're excited to introduce Convo, a platform designed to foster meaningful conversations and connections within an internet-native community.

Convo is not just an event management application - it's a space where ideas flourish, connections deepen, and learning happens naturally. Built with the Kernel community in mind, Convo aims to facilitate the kind of deep, meaningful conversations that make our community special.

## Start a Convo

We're just getting started, and we'd love for you to be part of this journey. Join us in shaping the future of community conversations.
