On April 29, 2025, there was a critical database loss. You may notice some irregularities in the app.

Here’s what you need to know:
- You may need to log out and log back in to refresh your session.
- Some upcoming conversations or recurring convos may be missing. If you had an upcoming convo that isn’t showing, please contact me directly.
- Some RSVP statuses may appear incorrectly.
- The date and time of conversations you proposed might have shifted.

For issues or missing data, reach out to me directly at [angela@kernel.community](mailto:angela@kernel.community) or [DM on Slack](https://kernel-community.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=U01D1166621). We are working to recover and rebuild as much as possible
